Here's how different types of exhaust systems can affect the car:\n\n1. **Stock Exhaust:** The factory exhaust is designed to balance noise regulations, emissions, and performance. It provides a refined sound that is relatively quiet and subdued, suitable for daily driving. Performance is optimized for reliability and smooth power delivery.\n\n2. **Cat-Back Exhaust:** This replaces the exhaust system from the catalytic converter back. It often uses larger diameter piping and less restrictive mufflers. The result is a deeper, louder exhaust note with improved exhaust flow, which can increase horsepower and torque slightly, typically in the range of 5-10 hp gains.\n\n3. **Axle-Back Exhaust:** This replaces only the section from the rear axle to the exhaust tip. It primarily changes the sound rather than performance because the upstream piping remains stock. It can make the exhaust note louder and more aggressive without major power gains.\n\n4. **Turbo-Back Exhaust:** This replaces the exhaust system from the turbocharger outlet back to the exhaust tip, including downpipe and cat-back sections. This setup reduces backpressure significantly, improving turbo spool time and increasing power gains more substantially (could be 10-30 hp or more depending on other modifications). It also makes the exhaust sound louder and more aggressive.\n\n5. **Headers and Downpipe Upgrades:** Replacing stock headers with aftermarket ones and upgrading to high-flow downpipes can drastically improve exhaust flow, turbo efficiency, and power output. This also changes the exhaust tone, often making it raspier or more metallic.\n\n6. **Material and Design:** Exhausts made from stainless steel or titanium are lighter, which can improve handling slightly. Designs like straight-through mufflers produce louder, freer-flowing sound, while chambered mufflers offer a deeper, more refined tone.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Sound: Stock < Axle-back < Cat-back < Turbo-back with headers/downpipe\n- Performance: Stock < Axle-back (minimal) < Cat-back (moderate) < Turbo-back + headers/downpipe (significant)\n\nChoosing an exhaust depends on your priorities—whether you want a subtle sound with slight gains or aggressive sound with maximum performance.\n\nWould you like recommendations for specific exhaust brands or setups for the MK5 Supra GR?"",""sources"":[{""url"":""https://www.supraforums.com/threads/exhaust-systems-performance-and-sound-comparison.1456789/"",""hostname"":""supraforums.com"",""title"":""Exhaust Systems Performance and Sound Comparison"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.supraforums.com/favicon.ico""},{""url"":""https://www.torqued.com/best-supra-a90-exhaust/"",""hostname"":""torqued.com"",""title"":""Best Supra A90 Exhaust: Sound & Performance Guide"",""iconUrl"":""https://torqued.com/favicon.ico""}]}"

During a live break, participants buy spots in a box or case of baseball cards, and as the box is opened live (usually via streaming), cards are distributed to participants based on their chosen team or spot. Since the cards come from sealed packs or boxes, there is a chance to pull rare or valuable cards, such as autographs, rookie cards, or limited edition inserts. However, the rarity and value of the cards you might get depend on the specific product being broken and luck. Live breaks can be exciting because of the possibility of finding rare cards, but it's important to understand that not every break will yield high-value cards."",""sources"":[{""url"":""https://www.beckett.com/news/what-are-live-sports-card-breaks/"",""hostname"":""beckett.com"",""title"":""What Are Live Sports Card Breaks?"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.beckett.com/favicon.ico""},{""url"":""https://www.cardboardconnection.com/live-breaks-guide"",""hostname"":""cardboardconnection.com"",""title"":""Live Breaks Guide - How to Participate in Sports Card Breaks"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.cardboardconnection.com/favicon.ico""}]}"
