Cards in mint or near-mint condition are more valuable.\n\n3. **Identify Card Rarity:** Look at the symbol at the bottom right of the card's artwork. A circle means common, a diamond means uncommon, and a star means rare. Holofoil cards or special variants (like GX, EX, V, or VMAX) are typically rarer.\n\n4. **Research Card Set and Number:** Cards from early sets (like Base Set, Jungle, Fossil) or special sets are often more valuable. Use online databases or apps to check the card number and set.\n\n5. **Use a UV Light or Magnifier:** To check for authenticity and condition details.\n\n6. **Beware of Fakes:** Some mystery boxes may contain counterfeit cards.
