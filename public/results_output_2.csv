This code corresponds to the original paint color used by the manufacturer.\n\n2. **Color Matching Technology:** Using the paint code, technicians can mix the base color paint. However, because paint can fade over time or lighting conditions vary, technicians often use spectrophotometers—devices that analyze the color of the existing paint on the vehicle—to get precise color data.\n\n3. **Custom Mixing:** With the data from the spectrophotometer and the paint code, technicians custom mix the paint to match the exact shade, gloss, and texture.\n\n4. **Test Application:** The mixed paint is applied to a test panel and compared under various lighting conditions to the vehicle's original paint.\n\n5. **Adjustment and Final Application:** If needed, adjustments are made to the paint mix until a perfect match is achieved. Then, the OEM part is painted, finished with clear coats if necessary, and polished to match the vehicle’s finish.\n\nThis process ensures that repaired or replaced parts maintain the vehicle's aesthetic integrity.\n\nWould you like information on where to get this service done in Loveland, CO?"",""sources"":[{""url"":""https://www.autobodynews.com/index.php/industry-news/item/12333-how-to-match-paint-colors"",""hostname"":""www.autobodynews.com"",""title"":""How to Match Paint Colors"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.autobodynews.com/favicon.ico""},{""url"":""https://www.ppgrefinish.com/technology/color-matching/"",""hostname"":""www.ppgrefinish.com"",""title"":""Color Matching Technology | PPG Refinish"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.ppgrefinish.com/favicon.ico""}]}"
