This code corresponds to the original paint color used by the manufacturer.\n\n2. **Color Matching Technology:** Using the paint code, technicians can mix the base color paint. However, because paint can fade over time or lighting conditions vary, technicians often use spectrophotometersâ€”devices that analyze the color of the existing paint on the vehicleâ€”to get precise color data.\n\n3. **Custom Mixing:** With the data from the spectrophotometer and the paint code, technicians custom mix the paint to match the exact shade, gloss, and texture.\n\n4. **Test Application:** The mixed paint is applied to a test panel and compared under various lighting conditions to the vehicle's original paint.\n\n5. **Adjustment and Final Application:** If needed, adjustments are made to the paint mix until a perfect match is achieved. Then, the OEM part is painted, finished with clear coats if necessary, and polished to match the vehicleâ€™s finish.\n\nThis process ensures that repaired or replaced parts maintain the vehicle's aesthetic integrity.\n\nWould you like information on where to get this service done in Loveland, CO?"",""sources"":[{""url"":""https://www.autobodynews.com/index.php/industry-news/item/12333-how-to-match-paint-colors"",""hostname"":""www.autobodynews.com"",""title"":""How to Match Paint Colors"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.autobodynews.com/favicon.ico""},{""url"":""https://www.ppgrefinish.com/technology/color-matching/"",""hostname"":""www.ppgrefinish.com"",""title"":""Color Matching Technology | PPG Refinish"",""iconUrl"":""https://www.ppgrefinish.com/favicon.ico""}]}"
